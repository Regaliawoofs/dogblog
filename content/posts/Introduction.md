**Hello!**

My name is Rey, and this blog is about my life experiences in tech. Many posts will be technical rambling, information security related issues, and deep dives into projects im working on, while others may be about the furry fandom, queer discovery, and my transition. 

Here are a few of my socials that I'm most active on if you want to keep up with me!

- **[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/reywoofs.bsky.social)** 
- [**Mastodon**](https://infosec.exchange/@Regalia_woofs) 
- [**Telegram**](https://t.me/Regalia_woofs)

A few interesting things about me!
- Working on bladesmithing as a hobby
- I've been flipping Balisongs for about 5 years
- Going back to school as of 2022!

Thank you for reading, and sticking around to see what's to come!

-RW
